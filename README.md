Welcome to our Unity game project! This project was created in collaboration with my friend and classmate El Mahdi Id Lahcen using the Unity game engine. We applied several design patterns and incorporated concepts from graph theory to develop this game.

## Features

- **Design Patterns**: Utilized Singleton and Strategy design patterns.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Followed the paradigm of dynamic programming.
- **Graph Theory**: Incorporated shortest path algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra.
